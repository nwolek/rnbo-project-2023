# rnbo-project-2023
Collaboration with my DIGA 366 students to create a new VST instrument using Cycling74's RNBO.

## Description

In the early weeks of the semester, we will work together to explore the [new features of Cycling74's RNBO](https://cycling74.com/products/rnbo). 
Our goal will be to design VST plug-ins (at least one, but maybe more!) that highlight basic concepts of synthesis, sampling, processing, and control. 
They must be delivered with sufficient documentation in time for the MIDI unit in DIGA 161A. 

## Background

In the DIGA 366 course, students complete advanced projects using a variety of software and hardware tools. 
This course explores topics such as immersive audio, gestural controllers, live performance practices, instrument design, sound installations, and software programming. 
Creating VST plug-ins fits nicely within this context nicely. 

In the DIGA 161A course, students have a project called "theme music". 
Each student will create 2 contrasting theme songs using MIDI sequencing, basic synthesis, and basic sampling. 
These must use at least 4 different sound sources and conform to the conventions of a theme music (i.e., fit time limits, convey a mood, be attention getting, evolve over time, etc.).
These students are using [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm), which has very limited MIDI softsynths.

This is my first attempt to link projects in these two courses. 
Hopefully having a concrete outcome where the advanced project benefits peers in a beginning course will make learning about RNBO more engaging for my advanced students.
